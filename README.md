# floating-objects
I came across a video from Lex Fridman where he showcased a 3d torus rendering, written in the shape of a torus. The math seemed simple enough and fun enough to try to do myself, for other objects.


the torus.cpp file is not mine. I just converted a few bits into cpp so that it was analogus to te project's purpose.
